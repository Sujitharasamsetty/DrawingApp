# DrawingApp

## I have developed a Drawing App using Kivi module. Below Image is a preview of Drawing App.


### Usage Of Kivi :- 

Kivy is a tool for developing Android Apps. The main usage of kivy is that it is cross platform and the same project can be used to publish apps on iOS , Android,
Windows.
